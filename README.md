# GET API using ReactJs

## Implementation
- I created a React hook(useEffect), and used it to fetch the details from the JSON file(API).
- I have used conditional statements. If there is data in the JSON file, only then it will return the card details.
- I have created a card component and displayed the user details on the user interface using the concept of props.
